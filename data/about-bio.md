## About

I'm Kaan, a software engineering student and full‑stack developer who enjoys building small, focused web experiences that feel fast and playful.

## Work

I like working on the full stack: designing how an interface should feel, wiring up APIs, and making sure everything runs smoothly in production.

## Life

Outside of code, I’m usually playing games, exploring new places, working out, or reading about new technologies. I care a lot about animals and try to keep the same curiosity and patience in my everyday life that I bring to my projects.
